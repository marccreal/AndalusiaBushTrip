A bush trip through the Spanish region of Andalusia for Microsoft Flight Simulator.

## Note
This bush trip is an alpha version. Only the first few legs are (fully) implemented. I would be happy for any kind of feedback, so please feel free to use the [issues page](https://github.com/marccreal/AndalusiaBushTrip/issues). Aside from technical issues, I am very interested in feedback on the difficulty level, length and quality of the legs.

## Install
1. Grab the latest [release](https://github.com/marccreal/AndalusiaBushTrip/releases/latest) and unzip to a directory of your choice.
2. Move the `marccreal-bushtrip-andalusia` folder inside the 'Community' folder of your MSFS installation. This folder can be located in different places:
   * Steam (standard): C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulator\Packages\Community
   * Microsoft Store (standard): C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.FlightSimulator_<RANDOMLETTERS>\LocalCache\Packages\Community
   * Boxed (standard): C:\Users\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Local\MSFSPackages\Community
   * If you chose a custom folder for the packages downloaded by the ingame installer: [YOUR CUSTOM INSTALL FOLDER]\Community

## Running
Simply start the game and go to the bush trip menu. The new trip should appear there and you can play it exactly in the same way as the bush trips initially provided with the game.
