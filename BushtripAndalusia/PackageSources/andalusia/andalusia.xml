            <SubLeg>
              <Descr>Your trip starts in the southeast of Andalusia in the city of Almeria, the capital of the province of the same name. Throughout history, Almeria's harbor has been an important hub for various goods from tin in the Bronze Age over rasins and silk in the time of Moorish reign to iron ore in the 19th century. Today, its economy builds mainly around vegetable production, with the whole region plastered with hunders of greenhouses, supplying much of Europe.
			  
			  After departure, head west over a first bunch of greenhouses towards the harbor and the historic center "La Medina" of Almeria, your first waypoint. Towering on a hill west of the Medina, you might be able to spot the Alcazaba, a huge Moorish castle. It is in fact the second largest among the Muslim fortresses of Andalusia, only topped by the famous Alhambra of Granada.</Descr>

			<SubLeg>
              <Descr>Head southwest towards the "Poniente Almeriense" also known as the "Mar de plastico" (sea of plastic). If you look down, you will understand, where this name originates. Admidst this "sea" you will find an (actual) lake - your next waypoint.</Descr>

			<SubLeg>
              <Descr>Close to the lake, you will find the city of El Ejido. As you might guess, the city is the centre of production for fruit and vegetables in this region. Special geological conditions made it possible that the region around El Ejido became Europ's biggest "winter garden". The vegtable economy brought wealth to the region but also social and ecological problems, like wage dumping, huge land and water consumption and massive use of pesticides.</Descr>

			<SubLeg>
              <Descr>Follow the road and the river heading southeast. The road later bends farther south, but you should stay with the river until you cross the dry river bed of the Rambla de Gergal. Shortly after, you can spot the river making a distinctive U-shaped bend with a railroad and a road crossing the western leg of the "U".</Descr>

              <Descr>Follow the railroad to the north. In the east, you can see Europe's only desert, the Desierto de Tabernas. With its landscape form similar to the one of Arizona or New Mexico, the region has been a popular movie setting in the 1960s for example for the "Spaghetti"-Western "Once Upon a Time in the West" and "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" by Sergio Leone.
			  When the railroad crosses the motorway A-92, you will be able to spot an airport surrounded by some greenhouses. This is your destination for this leg, the Aerodromo de Gergal (2575 AMSL).</Descr>
